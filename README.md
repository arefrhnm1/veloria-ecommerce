# Veloria Luxe

A **frontend-focused e‑commerce MVP** built with modern web technologies to showcase real‑world frontend skills, clean architecture, and attention to responsive, luxury‑oriented UI.

This project is designed as a **portfolio-grade MVP** for recruitment purposes, demonstrating my ability to design, structure, and implement a complete storefront experience using Next.js.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to:

* Serve as a **real MVP portfolio project** for frontend developer positions
* Demonstrate practical skills in **UI implementation, routing, and state management**
* Show a clear **learning journey and growth mindset** through clean code and structure

Rather than being a production-ready shop, Voloria Luxe focuses on **frontend excellence** and scalability for future iterations.
