# Voloria Luxe

A **frontend-focused e‑commerce MVP** built with modern web technologies to showcase real‑world frontend skills, clean architecture, and attention to responsive, luxury‑oriented UI.

This project is designed as a **portfolio-grade MVP** for recruitment purposes, demonstrating my ability to design, structure, and implement a complete storefront experience using Next.js.
